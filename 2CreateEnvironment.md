# Create an independent environment and activate it

## Create environments

An environment is like a virtualized Spack instance that you can use to aggregate package installations for a project or other purpose. 
It has an associated view, which is a single prefix where all packages from the environment are linked.

### Create environment
```
spack env create myproject
```
