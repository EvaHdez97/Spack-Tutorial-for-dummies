# Spack.yaml file and package.py files

## Package.py files 

In Spack, both the native Spack packages and the added packages that were not originally available have a package.py file that defines how to perform their installation and lists their dependencies.
In the following path, you can find the directories for all available Spack packages, including those installed externally. Inside each folder, you will find the package.py file.
```
ls /home/ehernandez/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages
```
```
ls /home/ehernandez/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/py-dtcv2-util/
package.py  __pycache__
```
